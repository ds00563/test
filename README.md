# trending_huggingface

This project aims to implement a "trending models" feature for Hugging Face models, similar to what GitHub provides for its repositories. The goal is to provide users with an at-a-glance view of the most downloaded Hugging Face models in real-time or at least on a daily basis.

## Project Background

Currently, the Hugging Face Hub API Endpoints' `list_models()` method provides the number of downloads for a model for the past month. However, it lacks more detailed, frequent statistics that would allow for real-time or daily tracking of model downloads.

In order to implement a robust and accurate trending models feature, more granular data on model downloads is required. The ability to fetch real-time or daily download statistics would be greatly beneficial.

An issue has been opened in the Hugging Face Hub repository to request this feature. You can find more details and track the progress here: [Issue #1520](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/1520)
